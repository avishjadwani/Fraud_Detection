# Fraud_Detection
Detecting Fraud using Un

Dataset : The dataset is taken from Kaggle.The link to the dataset is : https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Outlier_Func : This file contains user defined functions to preprocess data and to run  a model with Isolation forest Algorithm. 
		The result of the model is stored in a separate file as 'Outlier_result.xlsx'

Outlier_result : Result file with flagged fraud / non fraud cases

Fraud Detection: Markdown file with the functions as in Outlier_Func file.This file runs the model using these functions and generates result file. 
		It also computes the accuracy rate and true positive rate of the model. 

Results: 
The model classifies the fraud and non fraud cases with an accuracy of 0.96

The model uses unsupervised Machine Learning Model developed using Isolation Forest algorithm
